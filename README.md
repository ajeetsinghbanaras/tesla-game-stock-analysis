# Stock Data Analysis Project – Tesla & GameStop

This project is part of my final assignment for practicing Python, web scraping, data cleaning, and data visualization.  
I have collected stock price data and revenue information for two companies: **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)**.  
All analysis and plots are created using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
